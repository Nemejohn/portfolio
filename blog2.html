                            <p>
                                I didn‚Äôt grow up surrounded by tech. There weren‚Äôt blinking servers in my garage or robots whirring through my kitchen. Not until a friend of my mum and the need to create, 
                                I stumbled into programming‚Äîand it‚Äôs been an adventure of bugs, breakthroughs, and late-night debugging ever since.

                            <p>
                                My programming journey didn‚Äôt start with a burning question or a childhood fascination with computers. It started with a simple introduction‚Äîa friend 
                                of my mom‚Äôs who saw something in me and opened a door I never knew existed. At the time, I didn‚Äôt even own a laptop. I had no clue how to operate one. 
                                While others might have had early access to technology, my path began with a new device, limited exposure, and a lot of determination.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="row-content" id="third-section">
                            <h2>üö™ The Door That Opened</h2>
                            <p>
                                That introduction was more than a moment‚Äîit was a catalyst. 
                                It sparked a slow but steady fire that would shape how I see 
                                the world and what I believed I could build with my own two hands (and a keyboard).
                            </p>
                            <p><b>üöÄ Driven By Fire, Not Just Curiosity:</b></p>
                            <p>
                                Once I got started, there was no turning back. I made myself a promise: no matter what, I‚Äôd show up, practice, and do every assignment. 
                                I wasn‚Äôt just going to dip my toes in‚ÄîI was diving in headfirst. And because I wanted to know more beyond what we were taught, YouTube 
                                became my best friend. Tutorials, walkthroughs, coding marathons‚Äîmy free time was dedicated to building skills from scratch.

                                Three months in, I built my first project‚Äîa full-fledged <b>restaurant website</b>. It wasn‚Äôt just lines of code, it was proof that I 
                                could bring ideas to life with my own hands. That thrill? Unmatched. But I didn‚Äôt stop there. Fueled by confidence and caffeine, 
                                I challenged myself to rebuild the iconic <a href="https://apple.com" target="_blank"><b>Apple website</b></a>‚Äîwhich was a our justification project
                                preparing us for bigger future projects. From layout to interaction, every pixel was a triumph.

                            <p>
                                I wasn‚Äôt walking this path alone. My team and I pushed one another to grow. We stayed up late debugging together, swapping resources, and sharing breakthroughs. 
                                Slowly but surely, we didn‚Äôt just catch up‚Äîwe pulled ahead. We became the ones others turned to in class, not because we had the best tools, but because we refused to settle.

                                Then came my ‚Äúaha‚Äù moment‚Äîrealizing that clean code is great, but meaningful user experience is what makes digital products unforgettable. 
                                UI/UX design taught me to think beyond logic and into empathy. It‚Äôs not just about making things work, but making them feel right.

                                Sometimes, the most unexpected places become launchpads for big opportunities‚Äîand for me, that place was my church. <br><br>
                                After service one Sunday, I had a conversation that would shape my journey in a powerful way. I introduced myself and shared my 
                                portfolio with a mentor I deeply admire. After going through my work, he smiled and said something that stuck with me: <b><i>"Why not 
                                build something for the church?"</i></b> It wasn‚Äôt just advice‚Äîit was a challenge, and I accepted it with purpose.
                            </p>
                            <p><b>ü§ù Collaboration Meets Calling:</b></p>
                            <p>
                                To begin, I knew this wasn‚Äôt a solo mission. I met with our Priest to understand the church‚Äôs vision and the kind of digital presence it needed. 
                                From weekly announcements to service schedules and community outreach efforts, the goal was clear: build a site that reflects the spirit and heart of our congregation. <br><br>
                                I also connected with some talented photographers in the church. We captured vibrant, heartfelt moments‚Äîworship, community events, special ceremonies‚Äîall of which became the soul 
                                of the visual experience.
                            </p>
                            <p><b>üõ†Ô∏è Crafting the Experience:</b></p>
                            <p>
                                Armed with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a clear sense of purpose, I started designing a site that was not just functional but uplifting. Smooth navigation. Responsive layout. A clean, 
                                modern look that still honored the tradition and warmth of the church.
                            </p>
                            <p>Every section served a purpose:</p>
                            <p>
                                - <b>About the Church</b> ‚Äî our mission, leadership, and core values. <br>
                                - <b>Events & Announcements</b> ‚Äî to stay connected and involved. <br>
                                - <b>Photo Gallery</b> ‚Äî because the joy in our community deserves to be seen. <br>
                            </p>
                            <p><b>üåç A Digital Home for Our Spiritual Family:</b></p>
                            <p>
                                When the site went live, the feedback was overwhelming. It wasn‚Äôt just a website‚Äîit became a home. 
                                A space where people could reconnect, new visitors could learn about us, and everyone could feel welcome, even online. <br><br>
                                This project taught me that great work isn‚Äôt just about impressive code‚Äîit‚Äôs about impact. And there‚Äôs nothing more fulfilling 
                                than using your skills to serve a purpose bigger than yourself.

                                This isn‚Äôt just a career for me. It‚Äôs a craft. It‚Äôs about using code to solve real problems and bring ideas to life in the most elegant way possible.
