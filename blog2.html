                            <p>
                                I didn’t grow up surrounded by tech. There weren’t blinking servers in my garage or robots whirring through my kitchen. Not until a friend of my mum and the need to create, 
                                I stumbled into programming—and it’s been an adventure of bugs, breakthroughs, and late-night debugging ever since.

                            <p>
                                My programming journey didn’t start with a burning question or a childhood fascination with computers. It started with a simple introduction—a friend 
                                of my mom’s who saw something in me and opened a door I never knew existed. At the time, I didn’t even own a laptop. I had no clue how to operate one. 
                                While others might have had early access to technology, my path began with a new device, limited exposure, and a lot of determination.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="row-content" id="third-section">
                            <h2>🚪 The Door That Opened</h2>
                            <p>
                                That introduction was more than a moment—it was a catalyst. 
                                It sparked a slow but steady fire that would shape how I see 
                                the world and what I believed I could build with my own two hands (and a keyboard).
                            </p>
                            <p><b>🚀 Driven By Fire, Not Just Curiosity:</b></p>
                            <p>
                                Once I got started, there was no turning back. I made myself a promise: no matter what, I’d show up, practice, and do every assignment. 
                                I wasn’t just going to dip my toes in—I was diving in headfirst. And because I wanted to know more beyond what we were taught, YouTube 
                                became my best friend. Tutorials, walkthroughs, coding marathons—my free time was dedicated to building skills from scratch.

                            <p>
                                Three months in, I built my first project—a full-fledged <b>restaurant website</b>. It wasn’t just lines of code, it was proof that I 
                                could bring ideas to life with my own hands. That thrill? Unmatched. But I didn’t stop there. Fueled by confidence and caffeine, 
                                I challenged myself to rebuild the iconic <a href="https://apple.com" target="_blank"><b>Apple website</b></a>—which was a our justification project
                                preparing us for bigger future projects. From layout to interaction, every pixel was a triumph.
                            </p>
                            <p><b>🧑‍💻 Rising With My Team:</b></p>
                            <p>
                                I wasn’t walking this path alone. My team and I pushed one another to grow. We stayed up late debugging together, swapping resources, and sharing breakthroughs. 
                                Slowly but surely, we didn’t just catch up—we pulled ahead. We became the ones others turned to in class, not because we had the best tools, but because we refused to settle.

                                Then came my “aha” moment—realizing that clean code is great, but meaningful user experience is what makes digital products unforgettable. 
                                UI/UX design taught me to think beyond logic and into empathy. It’s not just about making things work, but making them feel right.

                            <h2>✨ A Holy Mission: Building My Church’s Website from Scratch</h2>
                            <p>
                                Sometimes, the most unexpected places become launchpads for big opportunities—and for me, that place was my church. <br><br>
                                After service one Sunday, I had a conversation that would shape my journey in a powerful way. I introduced myself and shared my 
                                portfolio with a mentor I deeply admire. After going through my work, he smiled and said something that stuck with me: <b><i>"Why not 
                                build something for the church?"</i></b> It wasn’t just advice—it was a challenge, and I accepted it with purpose.
                            </p>
                            <p><b>🤝 Collaboration Meets Calling:</b></p>
                            <p>
                                To begin, I knew this wasn’t a solo mission. I met with our Priest to understand the church’s vision and the kind of digital presence it needed. 
                                From weekly announcements to service schedules and community outreach efforts, the goal was clear: build a site that reflects the spirit and heart of our congregation. <br><br>
                                I also connected with some talented photographers in the church. We captured vibrant, heartfelt moments—worship, community events, special ceremonies—all of which became the soul 
                                of the visual experience.
                            </p>
                            <p><b>🛠️ Crafting the Experience:</b></p>
                            <p>
                                Armed with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a clear sense of purpose, I started designing a site that was not just functional but uplifting. Smooth navigation. Responsive layout. A clean, 
                                modern look that still honored the tradition and warmth of the church.
                            </p>
                            <p>Every section served a purpose:</p>
                            <p>
                                - <b>About the Church</b> — our mission, leadership, and core values. <br>
                                - <b>Events & Announcements</b> — to stay connected and involved. <br>
                                - <b>Photo Gallery</b> — because the joy in our community deserves to be seen. <br>
                            </p>
                            <p><b>🌍 A Digital Home for Our Spiritual Family:</b></p>
                            <p>
                                When the site went live, the feedback was overwhelming. It wasn’t just a website—it became a home. 
                                A space where people could reconnect, new visitors could learn about us, and everyone could feel welcome, even online. <br><br>
                                This project taught me that great work isn’t just about impressive code—it’s about impact. And there’s nothing more fulfilling 
                                than using your skills to serve a purpose bigger than yourself.

                                Today, I’m still exploring, still curious, and still building—but I’ll never forget where it all started. Just one connection, determination, 
                                and a dream to build something real. Whether it’s refining a layout, designing a seamless user flow, 
                                or writing that one line of JavaScript that pulls everything together—I’m in my <b>< e ></b><span style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">element</span><b>< /e ></b> <br><br>
                                This isn’t just a career for me. It’s a craft. It’s about using code to solve real problems and bring ideas to life in the most elegant way possible.
